# Arcade

This project aims to replicate the basic functionalities of an Arcade.  
It's architecture is made to be modular, capable of hot-swapping games and graphical rendering systems.  

The main modules interface was shared with the group leaded by Lucas Ludovic ([lucas.ludovic@epitech.eu](mailto:lucas.ludovic@epitech.eu)).
The documentation for this interface system and more can be found on [its own repository](https://github.com/dawpitech/anal).
